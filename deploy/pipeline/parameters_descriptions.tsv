counts	input_files/example_expression_data/GSE147507_RNA_Seq_Raw_Counts.tsv	"Unnormalised transcriptomics counts table, tab delimited, genes (using gene symbols or UniProt protein IDs) as rows and samples as columns."
meta	input_files/example_expression_data/GSE147507_mapping.txt	A tab-delimited two-column metadata table specifying test and control sample IDs in the following format. Here the sample names must match the headers in the normalised counts table.
lfccutoff	0.5	Absolute log2 fold change cut off value for determining differentially expressed genes
pcutoff	0.05	Adjusted p value cut off for determining differentially expressed genes
id_type	symbols	ID type in the input counts table: *symbol* or *uniprot*
hbps	input_files/sarscov2-human_ppis_gordon_april2020.txt	Viral - human protein-protein interaction table. Tab delimited with one line per interaction. Columns named *viral_protein* and *human_protein* Human proteins should be in UniProt format.
sars	input_files/sarscov2_protein_annotations.txt	"Gene symbol annotations for all input viral proteins, for ease of data interpretation. Tab-delimited with one line per protein. At least 2 columns named *Accession* and *gene_symbol*"
outdir	output_directory	Folder for all results to be saved to (subdirectories are created automatically for each step in the workflow)
anubixreactome	input_files/anubix_reactome_pathways.txt	Reactome pathway - gene associations provided by ANUBIX for network aware functional analysis. From the ANUBIX BitBucket website and referenced in the ANUBIX paper.
